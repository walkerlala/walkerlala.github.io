<p>
The from-read relation, abbreviated &ldquo;<tt>fr</tt>&rdquo;, seems
to be an acquired taste.
However, it is critically important to memory models, so it is therefore
also a critically important concept to fully understand.
The following gives descriptions, an example, and a formal definition
to help you better understand <tt>fr</tt>:

These sections are followed by a

and of course the everpresent
<a href="#Answers to Quick Quizzes">Answers to Quick Quizzes</a>.

<p>
This document focuses solely on the <tt>fr</tt> relation.
More information on other aspects of <tt>herd</tt> may be found
<a href="herd.html">here</a>, with additional relations tabulated
<a href="herd.html#built-in relations">here</a> and
<a href="herd.html#few extra relations">here</a>,
and with operators and functions tabulated
<a href="herd.html#functions and operators">here</a>.

<h2><a name="Informal Descriptions">Informal Descriptions</a></h2>

<p>
First, <tt>fr</tt> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation"><i>relation</i></a>,
or more specifically, a set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair"><i>ordered pairs</i></a>.
In the case of <tt>fr</tt>, the first entry of each pair is always a read
and the second is always a write.
Thus, a given pair in a <tt>fr</tt> relation can be said to <i>link</i>
the read to the write.

<p>
The description in
<a href="LinuxMMModel.html">the main article</a>
may be paraphrased as follows:

<blockquote>
	<p>
	<tt>fr</tt> is a
	relation linking any given read to every write to the same
	variable that executes too late to affect the value returned
	by that read.
</blockquote>

<p>
Another description is as follows:

<blockquote>
	<p>
	<tt>fr</tt> is a relation linking a given read <tt>R</tt>
	from a given variable <tt>x</tt> with all the writes to <tt>x</tt>
	that overwrite the value read by <tt>R</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Key points include:

<ol>
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> always links from reads to writes.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> always links reads and writes to the same
	variable, in other words, it never links reads from one variable
	to writes to some other variable.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> is a one-to-many relation, possibly linking
	a single read to multiple writes
	(but, as noted earlier, all to the same variable).
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> can be empty, for example, when each
	read returns its variable's final value.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> never links to an initialization
	&ldquo;write&rdquo;.
<li>	Given a pair of reads <tt>R1</tt> and <tt>R2</tt> from the same
	variable, if <tt>R1</tt> reads from an earlier write than
	does <tt>R2</tt>, then <tt>R1</tt> will have the larger
	number of pairs in the <tt>fr</tt> relation.
</ol>

Why can't <tt>fr</tt> link a read to an initialization &ldquo;write&rdquo;?
<br><a href="#qq1answer">Answer</a>

<p>
Given these descriptions, it is time to proceed to an example.

<h2><a name="Example">Example</a></h2>

<p>
Our example is based on the following
<a name="C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>:

<blockquote>
<a href="C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">Litmus Test #fr-1</a>
<pre>
 1 C C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus
 2
 3 {
 4 a=0;
 5 }
 6
 7 P0(int *a)
 8 {
 9   WRITE_ONCE(*a, 1);
10 }
11
12 P1(int *a)
13 {
14   WRITE_ONCE(*a, 2);
15 }
16
17 P2(int *a)
18 {
19   WRITE_ONCE(*a, 3);
20 }
21
22 P3(int *a)
23 {
24   r1 = READ_ONCE(*a);
25   r2 = READ_ONCE(*a);
26   r3 = READ_ONCE(*a);
27   r4 = READ_ONCE(*a);
28 }
29
30 exists
31 (3:r1=0 /\ 3:r2=1 /\ 3:r3=2 /\ 3:r4=3)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping in mind that initialization counts as a write, and focusing on
executions that satisfy the &ldquo;<tt>exists</tt>&rdquo; clause
on lines&nbsp;30 and&nbsp;31,
the read on line&nbsp;24 (call it <tt>R1</tt>) reads the initial value
(call it <tt>W0</tt>),
line&nbsp;25 (call it <tt>R2</tt>) reads the value written on line&nbsp;9
(call it <tt>W1</tt>),
line&nbsp;26 (call it <tt>R3</tt>) reads the value written on line&nbsp;14
(call it <tt>W2</tt>), and
line&nbsp;27 (call it <tt>R4</tt>) reads the value written on line&nbsp;19
(call it <tt>W3</tt>).
The order of the writes is then <tt>W0</tt>, <tt>W1</tt>, <tt>W2</tt>,
and finally&nbsp;<tt>W3</tt>.

<p>
This means that the pairs in the <tt>fr</tt> relation linking from <tt>R1</tt>
are <tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W1</tt>, <tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W2</tt>, and
<tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>.
Those from <tt>R2</tt> are
<tt>R2</tt>&#10230;<tt>W2</tt> and <tt>R2</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>.
There is but one from <tt>R3</tt>, namely <tt>R3</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>.
Finally, there are no <tt>fr</tt> pairs linking from <tt>R4</tt>
because it reads from the final write.

<p>
This example will help illustrate the following formal definition of
<tt>fr</tt>.

<h2><a name="Formal Definition">Formal Definition</a></h2>

<p>
It turns out that there is a simple formal definition of
<tt>fr</tt> in terms of the more
intuitive <tt>rf</tt> and <tt>co</tt> relations.
But first, let's review those two relations:

<ol>
<li>	<tt>co</tt> = &ldquo;coherence&rdquo;, linking each write to
	all later writes to that same variable.
	Note that initialization is considered to be a &ldquo;before the
	beginning of time&rdquo; write, so for each non-initialization
	write by any process to a given variable, there is a <tt>co</tt>
	pair linking from that variable's initialization to that write.
<li>	<tt>rf</tt> = &ldquo;reads from&rdquo;, linking a given write to
	each read that loads the value stored by that write.
</ol>

<p>
In the
<a href="#C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>
above, the <tt>co</tt> relation contains the pairs
<tt>W0</tt>&#10230;<tt>W1</tt>,
<tt>W0</tt>&#10230;<tt>W2</tt>,
<tt>W0</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>,
<tt>W1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W2</tt>,
<tt>W1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>, and
<tt>W2</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>.
The <tt>rf</tt> relation contains
<tt>W0</tt>&#10230;<tt>R1</tt>,
<tt>W1</tt>&#10230;<tt>R2</tt>,
<tt>W2</tt>&#10230;<tt>R3</tt>, and
<tt>W3</tt>&#10230;<tt>R4</tt>.

<p>
Next, we need to introduce the inverse of a relation,
which simply reverses each pair in that relation.
In herd, the inverse operator is a postfix &ldquo;<tt>^-1</tt>&rdquo;, so
that <tt>rf^-1</tt> links each read to the write that supplied that
read's value.
In the
<a href="#C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>
above, <tt>rf^-1</tt> contains
<tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W0</tt>,
<tt>R2</tt>&#10230;<tt>W1</tt>,
<tt>R3</tt>&#10230;<tt>W2</tt>, and
<tt>R4</tt>&#10230;<tt>W3</tt>.

<p>
Finally, we also need the concept of sequencing, which glues two
relations together to produce a third relation.
In herd, the sequencing operator is an infix &ldquo;<tt>;</tt>&rdquo;,
so that if relation <tt>A</tt> contains x&#10230;y and relation
<tt>B</tt> contains y&#10230;z, then the relation <tt>A;B</tt>
contains x&#10230;z.

<p>
These relations and operators permit <tt>fr</tt> to be expressed
formally as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
	fr = rf^-1;co
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, given a read, go backwards to the
write that supplied that read's value, then go forward to any
later write to that same variable.
Then <tt>fr</tt> will link the read to the later write.

<p><a name="Quick Quiz 2"><b>Quick Quiz 2</b>:</a>
But <tt>rf^-1</tt> goes backwards in time!
How can real hardware possibly do that???
<br><a href="#qq2answer">Answer</a>

<p>
In the
<a href="#C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>
above, <tt>rf^-1</tt> contains
<tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W0</tt> and
<tt>co</tt> contains
<tt>W0</tt>&#10230;<tt>W1</tt>.
The <tt>rf^-1;co</tt> set of relations therefore contains
<tt>R1</tt>&#10230;<tt>W1</tt>, and much else besides.

<p><a name="Quick Quiz 3"><b>Quick Quiz 3</b>:</a>
What is the full contents of <tt>fr</tt> for the
<a href="#C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>

<br><a href="#qq3answer">Answer</a>

<p><a name="Quick Quiz 4"><b>Quick Quiz 4</b>:</a>
Why the asymmetry between <tt>rf</tt>, which links each write
to only those reads returning the value written (but not later reads),
and <tt>fr</tt>, which links each read to <i>all</i> the writes
that were too late to affect the value read, rather than just the
earliest such write?
<br><a href="#qq4answer">Answer</a>

<p>
It can be seen that any read returning the initial value of its variable
will be <tt>fr</tt>-related to all writes to that variable.
Similarly, any read returning the final value of its variable will not
be <tt>fr</tt>-related to any writes at all.

<h2><a name="Temporal Consequences">Temporal Consequences</a></h2>

<p>
It is important to understand that the <tt>fr</tt> relationship does not
imply any sort of temporal relationship.
Due to the finite speed with which information propagates through
real systems, it is possible for a read to get a value from a write
whose value is already destined to be overwritten, as shown below:

<p><img src="fr.svg" alt="fr.svg" width="65%"></p>

<p>
In this example, the read returned the initialization value of zero
despite the write of the value &ldquo;1&rdquo; having already executed.
However, this new value had not yet propagated from CPU&nbsp;0 to
CPU&nbsp;3, so this later read, being unaware of the new value, returned
the old one.
The <tt>fr</tt> relationship can therefore go backwards in time, not due
to any sort of computing-system time machine, but rather due to the finite
speed at which updates propagate through the computer system.

<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This document has attempted to illuminate <tt>fr</tt> with a couple of
descriptions, an example, and a formal definition.
It is worth repeating the list of <tt>fr</tt>'s properties:

<ol>
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> always links from reads to writes.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> always links reads and writes to the same
	variable, in other words, it never links reads from one variable
	to writes to some other variable.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> is a one-to-many relation, possibly linking
	a single read to multiple later writes
	(but, as noted earlier, all to the same variable).
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> can be empty, for example, when each
	read returns its variable's final value.
<li>	<tt>fr</tt> never links to an initialization
	&ldquo;write&rdquo;.
<li>	Given a pair of reads <tt>R1</tt> and <tt>R2</tt> from the same
	variable, if <tt>R1</tt> reads from an earlier write than
	does <tt>R2</tt>, then <tt>R1</tt> will have the larger
	number of pairs in the <tt>fr</tt> relation.
</ol>

Again, <tt>fr</tt> is often an acquired taste, but it is critically
important to memory models.
We hope that this document helped you to better understand <tt>fr</tt>!

<p><b>Quick Quiz 1</b>:
Why can't <tt>fr</tt> link a read to an initialization &ldquo;write&rdquo;?


</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Suppose that it did.
That would mean that the read returned some value prior to the
initialization &ldquo;write&rdquo;.
Just what value could that possibly be?

<p>
The answer to this last question if of course &ldquo;There is no such
value!&rdquo;
Therefore, <tt>fr</tt> cannot possibly link a read to an
initialization &ldquo;write&rdquo;.

<a name="qq2answer"></a>
<p><b>Quick Quiz 2</b>:
But <tt>rf^-1</tt> goes backwards in time!
How can real hardware possibly do that???


</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Real hardware really can respect <tt>fr=rf^-1;co</tt>, and without requiring
a time machine to do so.

<p>
First, in a mythical system having a total temporal and causal order
over all memory references, <tt>co</tt> must necessarily move farther
forward in time than <tt>rf^-1</tt> moves backwards.
Therefore, on such a system, <tt>fr</tt> relations will always
move forward in time.

<p>
Second, in weakly ordered systems, propagation delay accounts for
apparent time reversals.
For example, in the earlier
<a href="#C-FR+w+w+w+reads.litmus">litmus test</a>,
suppose that all three writes take place concurrently at time t=0.
Now, the finite speed of light and the atomic nature of matter means
that these three writes cannot be seen instantaneously across the
whole system.
It will instead take time for these writes to propagate.
Suppose that news of <tt>W1</tt> arrives at <tt>P3()</tt> at t=1,
<tt>W2</tt> at t=2, and <tt>W3</tt> at t=3.
Then the <tt>R3&#10230;W3</tt> relation extends &ldquo;backwards in
time&rdquo; from t=2 to t=0.
But no time machine was required: The apparent time reversal
was instead an artifact of propagation delay.

<p><b>Quick Quiz 4</b>:
Why the asymmetry between <tt>rf</tt>, which links each write
to only those reads returning the value written (but not later reads),
and <tt>fr</tt>, which links each read to <i>all</i> the writes
that were too late to affect the value read, rather than just the
earliest such write?


</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Either way, there is an asymmetry.
For example, if <tt>fr</tt> related each read only to the first too-late write,
then <tt>rf</tt> would be one-to-many and <tt>fr</tt> would not be.

<p>
Some readers might be interested in producing a simple
<tt>cat</tt> expression for a set of relations
that resembles <tt>rf</tt>, but included later reads, as well as a
simple expression for a set of relations that resembles <tt>fr</tt>, but
includes only the first too-late write.
