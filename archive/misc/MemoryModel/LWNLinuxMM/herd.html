<p>
The <tt>herd</tt> program reads in a litmus test and
evaluates it according to a memory model.
The model is contained in a <tt>.cat</tt> file
specified by the &ldquo;<tt>-model</tt>&rdquo; command-line option
(or a &ldquo;<tt>model</tt>&rdquo; line in the configuration file)
plus an optional <tt>.bell</tt> file
specified by the &ldquo;<tt>-bell</tt>&rdquo; option
(or a &ldquo;<tt>bell</tt>&rdquo; line in the configuration file).
The Bell file, if present, gets processed first.
Both files consist of statements in the <tt>cat</tt> language,
and <tt>herd</tt> treats them almost identically&mdash;the
only real difference is that the Bell file is allowed to
contain &ldquo;<tt>instructions</tt>&rdquo; statements but the
Cat file is not.
(The &ldquo;<tt>instructions</tt>&rdquo; statement defines
tags which can decorate elementary operations.
For instance, one such statement might specify that a
barrier operation can be decorated with an &ldquo;<tt>mb</tt>&rdquo; tag,
which could indicate that the operation is a full memory barrier.)
Typically a Bell file is used for common code that is shared
among multiple models, where each model would have its own Cat file.

<p>
After loading the Bell and Cat files, <tt>herd</tt> parses the
litmus-test program.
The program may contain macros
(for instance, &ldquo;<tt>smp_mb()</tt>&rdquo;)
which are expanded to internal constructs
(such as a barrier with an &ldquo;<tt>mb</tt>&rdquo; tag).
The mapping from user-level macros to internal constructs
is defined in a file like <tt>linux.def</tt> that is specified
by the &ldquo;<tt>-macros</tt>&rdquo; command-line option
(or a &ldquo;<tt>macros</tt>&rdquo; line in the configuration file).

<p>
Next, <tt>herd</tt> interprets the program by constructing a list of
events for each thread.
For programs written in a high-level language like C, this involves
breaking statements and expressions down into a series of elementary
operations (read, write, arithmetic/logic on registers, branch, and so on);
for programs in assembly language, the individual instructions
generally correspond directly to these operations.
However, atomic read-modify-write instructions always get represented
by two operations, a read and a write, linked by the built-in <tt>rmw</tt>
relation.

<p>
The events are organized as one list per thread, in program order.
This is not always straightforward, because of a subtle but important fact:
&ldquo;Program order&rdquo; refers to the order of instructions
as they are presented to the processor's execution unit,
<i>not</i> their order in the program's source or object code.
While the two orders are often the same, they will differ when branches
are present.
A forward branch causes some instructions to be left out of the event list,
and a backward branch can cause some instructions to be repeated in the list.

<p>
Since it is not known in advance whether a conditional branch will be
taken, each such branch causes <tt>herd</tt> to generate two event lists:
one in which the branch is taken and one in which it isn't.
Thus, a program containing two conditional branches will give rise to four
lists, a program containing three will give rise to eight, and so on.
The <tt>po</tt> relation then refers to the order of the events in an
individual list,
and <tt>herd</tt> has to test each list separately, as a possible
program execution.

<p>
When the program contains a loop, a conditional branch may be taken
an indefinitely large number of times.
In this situation the number of possible executions would quickly get
out of hand, so there is a limit on how many times <tt>herd</tt> will
allow a particular branch to appear in an execution
(specified by the &ldquo;<tt>-unroll</tt>&rdquo; command-line option),
typically set to 2.
Executions with a higher number of iterations simply will not be considered.

<p>
Then, given a candidate execution, <tt>herd</tt> has to determine, for each
read event, which write event stored the value that the read will retrieve.
Again, there's no way to know this in advance, so if a program has
more than one write to a particular variable, <tt>herd</tt> has to try
all possible combinations for the <tt>rf</tt> relation.
Just as with conditional branches, this can lead to exponential growth
in the number of possible executions to be tested.

<p>
As part of its processing of a candidate execution, <tt>herd</tt>
carries out a dataflow analysis of the values computed and stored in
the local variables (or CPU registers) for each thread.
This analysis gets used in several ways:

<ul>
<li>	<tt>herd</tt> checks each conditional branch, making sure that
	the branch's condition is true if and only if the execution
	has decided to take the branch.
<li>	<tt>herd</tt> checks the target address of each indirect memory
	access (i.e., access through a pointer or relative to a CPU
	register), making sure that the <tt>rf</tt> relation really
	does link writes and reads to the same target address.
<li>	<tt>herd</tt> determines exactly what data, address, or control
	<a href="LinuxMMModel.html#dependencies">dependencies</a> exist between
	memory-access events.
	These dependencies are made available to the model
	through the built-in <tt>data</tt>, <tt>addr</tt>, and <tt>ctrl</tt>
	relations.
</ul>

As an example of this last point, given the statement

<blockquote>
<pre>
WRITE_ONCE(*x, READ_ONCE(*y));
</pre>
</blockquote>

in the litmus-test program, <tt>herd</tt> would break it down into two events:

<blockquote>
<pre>
rtemp = READ_ONCE(*y)
WRITE_ONCE(*x, rtemp)
</pre>
</blockquote>

(where <tt>rtemp</tt> is a temporary local variable), and it would add a link

<blockquote>
<tt>rtemp = READ_ONCE(*y)</tt> &#10230; <tt>WRITE_ONCE(*x, rtemp)</tt>
</blockquote>

to the <tt>data</tt> relation.

<p>
Finally, once a particular choice for the <tt>po</tt> and <tt>rf</tt>
relations has been settled on, the execution checks out okay,
and the <tt>data</tt>, <tt>addr</tt>, and <tt>ctrl</tt> relations have
been set up, <tt>herd</tt> runs
the statements in the Bell and Cat files to see whether the memory model
considers the candidate execution to be allowed.
If any of the model's checks fail, the execution is abandoned.
Otherwise, <tt>herd</tt> evaluates the logical assertion at the end of
the litmus test.
It keeps track of the number of allowed executions for which the
assertion is true and the number for which it is false; these are the
numbers reported at the end in <tt>herd</tt>'s output.

<p>
Unlike <tt>po</tt> and <tt>rf</tt>, the <tt>co</tt> relation is not built-in.
It has to be computed explicitly by the memory model.
In practice this is done by the <tt>cos.cat</tt> file,
which is included near the start of the model's Cat file
(see for example line&nbsp;3 in each of the two RMO memory-model files above).
This involves another potentially exponential computation,
because it is necessary to try all possible orderings of the write accesses
to each variable.

<p>
<tt>herd</tt> works in terms of sets of events and relations between events.
(A relation is a collection of ordered pairs of events;
you can think of each ordered pair as a link
going from the first event in the pair to the second.)
The <tt>cat</tt> language used in the
<a name="Bell">Bell</a> and Cat files
is rich in operators for constructing and testing these sets and relations.

<p>
To begin with, <tt>herd</tt> has a number of built-in sets
used for classifying events.
Each event is automatically added to the appropriate sets.

<table cellpadding="3" border=3 align="center"><tbody>
<tr>	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Contents</th>
	<th>Comment</th>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>R</tt></th>
	<td>Read events</td>
	<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>W</tt></th>
	<td>Write events</td>
	<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>IW</tt></th>
	<td>Initial Write events</td>
	<td>&ldquo;writes&rdquo; that set a variable's initial value</td>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>FW</tt></th>
	<td>Final Write events</td>
	<td>values that are tested in the final assertion</td>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>M</tt></th>
	<td>Memory access events</td>

	<td>Fence events</td>
	<td>also known as Barrier events</td>
</tr>
<tr>	<th><tt>_</tt></th>
	<td>All events</td>
	<td>wildcard</td>

</tbody></table>

<p>
<a name="other statement types">In addition,</a>
using the &ldquo;<tt>enum</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>instructions</tt>&rdquo;
statements, a Bell file can define an enumerated list of tag values
and specify that instructions of a specific kind must be labelled
with one of these tags.
<tt>herd</tt> then creates a set for each tag value;
the name of the set is the same as the name of the tag but with the
first letter capitalized, and the set contains all events generated
from instructions labelled by the corresponding tag.
For example, the following <tt>cat</tt> code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
enum Accesses = 'once || 'release || 'acquire || 'deref
instructions R[{'once,'acquire,'deref}]
</pre>
</blockquote>

defines a bunch of <tt>Accesses</tt> tags,
and says that all read (&ldquo;<tt>R</tt>&rdquo;) instructions
should be labelled with a
&ldquo;<tt>once</tt>&rdquo;, an &ldquo;<tt>acquire</tt>&rdquo;,
or a &ldquo;<tt>deref</tt>&rdquo; tag.
Given this, the &ldquo;<tt>Once</tt>&rdquo; set would contain all events
corresponding to an instruction (possibly a read, possibly something else)
labelled with the &ldquo;<tt>once</tt>&rdquo; tag,
and similarly for the &ldquo;<tt>Release</tt>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<tt>Acquire</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>Deref</tt>&rdquo; sets.

<p>
<tt>herd</tt> also comes with a selection of
<a name="built-in relations">built-in relations</a>,
some of which we have already mentioned:

<p>
Although the language includes a variety of statement types,
the ones found most frequently in Bell and Cat files are assignment
(&ldquo;<tt>let</tt>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<tt>let rec</tt>&rdquo;)
and check statements.

&ldquo;<tt>let</tt>&rdquo; statements are self-explanatory;
we have already seen several examples in the RMO memory models above.
&ldquo;<tt>let rec</tt>&rdquo; statements,
used for mutually recursive definitions,
are more complex; we will see an example
<a href="StrongModel.html#Bell File: RCU Read-Side Critical Sections">here</a>.
Check statements come in three forms:

<ul>
<li>	&ldquo;<tt>acyclic &lt;expr&gt;</tt>&rdquo;
	requires the relation computed from &ldquo;<tt>expr</tt>&rdquo;
	not to have any cycles;
<li>	&ldquo;<tt>irreflexive &lt;expr&gt;</tt>&rdquo;
	requires the relation computed from &ldquo;<tt>expr</tt>&rdquo;
	not to have any links from an event to itself;
<li>	&ldquo;<tt>empty &lt;expr&gt;</tt>&rdquo;
	requires the set or relation computed from &ldquo;<tt>expr</tt>&rdquo;
	to be empty.
</ul>

If a check fails, it indicates that the memory model prohibits the
candidate execution under consideration;
that is, the memory model says that this execution could never occur.

<p>
A check can be negated by prefixing it with &ldquo;<tt>~</tt>&rdquo;.
Also, a check can be flagged by putting the &ldquo;<tt>flag</tt>&rdquo;
keyword in front of it.
Unlike a normal check, when a flagged check succeeds it indicates that
the execution has encountered some sort of semantic problem.
If this happens, <tt>herd</tt> adds a warning message to its output.

<p>
Along with the &ldquo;<tt>let</tt>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<tt>include</tt>&rdquo;, and check statements,
the only other types of statement we will see are
&ldquo;<tt>enum</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>instructions</tt>&rdquo;,
both briefly
<a href="#other statement types">mentioned earlier</a>.

<p>
The <tt>cat</tt> language supports many features we won't cover here, 
including higher-order sets and tuples, pattern matching, user-defined
functions, iteration, and recursion in the style of OCaml
(the language <tt>herd</tt> is written in).
<tt>herd</tt> itself also has a large number of features we won't discuss,
such as the ability to skip certain checks when
testing a memory model or to produce figures (like the ones in this
document) illustrating the events and relations in a particular
program execution.
More complete documentation can be found in the
<a href="http://diy.inria.fr/tst/doc/herd.html"><tt>herd</tt> manual</a>.

<p>
With this background, we are ready to examine larger, more realistic
memory models.
Something like the
<a href="StrongModel.html#Introduction to the Linux-Kernel Memory Models">Linux-kernel memory models</a>,
in fact.
