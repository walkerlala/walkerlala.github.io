            "summary": "Concurrency has always been a big topic ever since the 1960s. I learned about this topic from my Operating System courses one year ago but never feel confident to tell any other people that I really understand it. I do have some insights into this topic and have read a few books/articles related to it. However, the more I read and know about it, the more it seems to be left unknown. I suppose this is probably the reason for the old saying \"the consequence of knowing too much\".  Nevertheless, I want to summarize and present some \"cases\" that I find really interesting these days as I read and think. I will try to show you how we can  get into the \"dark\" side of those techniques, with some necessary theories. Specifically, in this essay, I would try show you how to implement a lock in the kernel, and what techniques and theories are required."

Do these process share the same file offset when they try to write? What about writing to the same file in the same process using different threads?(Take Linux for example.)"
